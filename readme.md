# The LESB
The LESB (LCC Enhancement for the Sortation of Books) is 
a classification system based on, as the name would imply, the Library of Congress 
Classification system (LCC). It is extraneous, devoid of practical use, and completely 
ideologically slanted by queer feminist communism; factors we found were notably absent 
in the LCC and thus we aimed to include in our enhancement of that system. The LESB is 
a work in progress, whose additions are mostly based on what yet-unclassified books 
find their way onto a certain bookshelf.
