# The LESB
The LESB (LCC Enhancement for the Sortation of Books) is 
a classification system based on, as the name would imply, the Library of Congress 
Classification system (LCC). It is extraneous, devoid of practical use, and completely 
ideologically slanted by queer feminist communism; factors we found were notably absent 
in the LCC and thus we aimed to include in our enhancement of that system. The LESB is 
a work in progress, whose additions are mostly based on what yet-unclassified books 
find their way onto a certain bookshelf.

In a collection sorted using the LESB, books are first grouped together by the language
they are written in; Sort the language groupings by alphebetical order of their
ISO 639-3 code; the exception to this protocol is when the ISO 639-3 code is offensive,
outdated, or otherwise no longer applicable in good concience; in such a case, create
or find a consensus around a code based on the language name deemed most socially 
concious and put the books under that code.
