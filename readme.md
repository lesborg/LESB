# LESB
The LESB (Library of Congress Classification (LCC) Enhancement for the Sortation of Books) is 
a classification system based on, as the name would imply, the LCC. It is extraneous,
devoid of practical use, and completely ideologically slanted by queer feminist communism; 
factors we found were notably absent in the LCC and thus aimed to include in our enhancement
of that system. The LESB is a work in progress, whose additions are mostly based on what 
yet-unclassified books find their way onto a certain bookshelf.
